                    <h2 class="major">Introduction</h2>
                    <p>This project focuses on designing a robotic parrot prototype as part of the Robotic Modelling and Drone Skin Design module. The goal was to explore both virtual and physical prototyping processes, beginning with hand-drawn sketches to visualize the concept and inform later stages of CAD and physical design.</p>
                    <p>From the outset, the objective was to simulate a professional design and development process that might occur in an actual robotics or consumer electronics product pipeline. The robotic parrot serves as a vehicle to integrate multiple disciplines: artistic sketching, digital 3D modelling, engineering design, and practical fabrication techniques. The choice of a parrot as the subject was both creative and functional. Parrots are known for their expressive body language, vivid features, and symbolic links to communication, which makes them a natural fit for a robotic prototype aimed at showcasing movement and interaction.</p>
                    <p>The project began with initial brainstorming sessions to determine the form, scale, and function of the parrot. Sketching was used as the primary conceptual tool, providing a tactile and intuitive way to iterate design ideas before committing to digital work. These sketches played an essential role in shaping the parrot’s physical features, including wing curvature, beak design, and posture. This stage was not only useful for aesthetics but also important in planning mechanical constraints for future movement or articulation.</p>
                    <p>Following the sketching phase, the concept was transferred into a digital environment using 3D modelling software in this case, Blender or Fusion 360. The group sourced a reference 3D model of a parrot (as shown in the image below) and used it as a visual foundation to inform our own digital sculpting approach. While we did not use the model directly, we analysed its structure and attempted to develop a unique version that reflected our own design vision. The modelling process involved reshaping the body, adjusting proportions, and modifying features such as the beak, feathers, and posture to make it distinct from the original. Particular attention was given to symmetry, wing detailing, and realistic topology flow to ensure the model would be both aesthetically compelling and structurally viable for printing.</p>
                    <p>One of the key learning objectives of this module is to understand how physical and digital prototyping techniques interact. As such, every decision in the virtual stage was made with real-world fabrication in mind. The idea of the parrot model was to be split into multiple parts for 3D printing, considering tolerances, joint connections, and ease of assembly. Materials like PLA were considered due to their wide availability and suitability for educational or prototype-grade builds.</p>
                    <p>Throughout the project, particular emphasis was placed on the iterative nature of design. Each stage informed the next, and feedback from one domain often led to adjustments in another. For example, while sculpting the parrot digitally, it became clear that some features were too delicate to print with standard nozzles and would need to be thickened or simplified. Similarly, the process of planning the articulation (e.g., movable wings or rotating neck) influenced the geometry and segmentation of the model.</p>
                    <p>Another reason the parrot was chosen as the prototype is because of its potential future adaptability. While this version of the prototype focuses primarily on the physical structure, future iterations could integrate simple electromechanical systems such as servos or microcontrollers to allow for motion. The parrot’s natural range of movement offers many possibilities for exploring robotics, including wing flapping, head tilting, and vocal mimicry. These possibilities helped motivate the shape and scale choices during the sketching and modelling phases, aiming to create a frame that could one day house electronics. </p>
                    <p>Furthermore, the project helps bridge the gap between creative expression and technical execution. An important intersection in modern engineering education. The ability to combine artistic sensibility with practical fabrication techniques is increasingly valuable in industries that prioritise user experience and aesthetics alongside functionality. Whether designing animatronics, smart toys, or bio-inspired machines, professionals must understand both form and function, and this project provides an entry point into that mindset.</p>
                    <p>Ultimately, this portfolio aims to document the complete journey of creating a robotic parrot prototype, from idea to execution. It reflects both the creative imagination required in conceptual design and the structured, technical thinking involved in bringing a design to life. By presenting this work in a cohesive narrative supported by visuals, critical reflections, and justifications, the portfolio serves both as an academic submission and a potential showcase of practical design capability.</p>

                    <h2 class="major">Virtual Prototype</h2>
                    <p>Using Blender, the parrot sketch was translated into a virtual 3D model. The design focused on recreating key features such as the beak, wings, and body shape. The modelling process involved sculpting, mirroring, and basic mesh editing tools to create a smooth, organic structure that resembles a parrot.</p>
                    <p>This model served as a starting point for experimentation. One of the group’s core objectives was to transform the base design into something original and more in line with the creative and functional vision outlined in our early sketches. The sourced model included distinctive features such as exaggerated wingspan, a perched stance, and a pirate hat. All of which presented opportunities to either refine or redesign aspects to make the final outcome more fitting for a robotics-oriented prototype.</p>
                    <p>We set out with the intention of modifying the original geometry using Blender’s sculpting and mesh editing tools. The idea was not to rely on the existing model for the final result but to use it as a base to dissect and evolve into something that would feel uniquely ours. The plan included reshaping areas such as the wings to allow for potential articulation points and simplifying the textures on the body to make it more suitable for a printable, modular design. The pirate hat feature present in the original model was also identified as something we might remove or replace with a more technical or minimalistic headpiece, aligning the design more closely with a robotic aesthetic.</p>
                    <p>Special attention was intended to be given to structural and symmetrical adjustments. The plan was to use Blender’s mirror modifier to maintain perfect symmetry while experimenting with variations in the wing configuration, beak shape, and leg structure. This approach would allow changes made on one side of the model to be automatically mirrored on the other, helping reduce modelling time and ensure visual consistency. Additionally, we aimed to decimate and clean the mesh to simplify the geometry while preserving essential form details. A necessary step to prepare the model for slicing and 3D printing later on.</p>
                    <p>One of the main challenges faced in this stage of the project was maintaining the balance between stylisation and realism. While the original model is quite dramatic and artistic in pose, our goal was to refine it toward a design that could be broken into parts for physical fabrication. That meant reducing unnecessary complexity and considering the practicalities of print orientation, support structures, and assembly. The idea was to redesign the feet, claws, and base of the parrot to either flatten or modularise them, making the model easier to print and better suited for future articulation.</p>
                    <p>At this point in development, the team is still actively working on evolving the model further. We are exploring ways to break the model into multiple parts such as detachable wings, a separate head, and a modular base that could allow for movement or electronics to be added later.</p>
                    <p>While the current model started from an external reference, the design direction is intended to become increasingly our own. The planned modifications are guided by both aesthetic goals and engineering constraints. The group remains committed to continuing development and pushing the design further in terms of creativity and technical execution, with the ultimate aim of producing a 3D model that is not only visually appealing but also functionally viable for future physical prototyping and robotic experimentation.</p>

                    <p>The group intends to 3D print the parrot model using PLA filament. The current plan is to separate the model into multiple parts such as the body, wings, beak, and claws to simplify the printing and assembly process. Once printed, the components will be assembled. After assembly, the final prototype will be evaluated for balance, proportion, and realism to reflect the initial design intent. We also plan to incorporate basic articulation in the wings or neck to simulate simple robotic movement.</p>

                <h2 class="major">Critical Appraisal</h2>
                <p>Throughout this project, various tools and techniques have been explored to develop the parrot prototype. Blender was selected for 3D modelling due to its powerful sculpting tools and flexibility in creating organic shapes, which suited the parrot’s curved and feathered form. The group found it particularly effective for designing naturalistic body features.</p>
                <p>3D printing was chosen as the method for physical prototyping, specifically using PLA filament. This material was selected for its ease of use, low cost, and availability, making it ideal for producing rapid prototypes. However, the team anticipates some limitations with print resolution and strength, particularly for smaller or delicate features such as the beak or claws.</p>
                <p>Alternative methods such as resin printing, laser cutting, or composite materials were considered. Resin printing could offer finer detail but would increase cost and complexity. Laser cutting was deemed unsuitable due to the organic nature of the parrot design. Overall, the selected methods balance realism, practicality, and affordability, making them appropriate for this academic project.</p>
