                    <h2 class="major">Introduction</h2>
                    <p>This project focuses on designing a robotic parrot prototype as part of the Robotic Modelling and Drone Skin Design module. The goal was to explore both virtual and physical prototyping processes, beginning with hand-drawn sketches to visualize the concept and inform later stages of CAD and physical design.</p>
                    <p>From the outset, the objective was to simulate a professional design and development process that might occur in an actual robotics or consumer electronics product pipeline. The robotic parrot serves as a vehicle to integrate multiple disciplines: artistic sketching, digital 3D modelling, engineering design, and practical fabrication techniques. The choice of a parrot as the subject was both creative and functional. Parrots are known for their expressive body language, vivid features, and symbolic links to communication, which makes them a natural fit for a robotic prototype aimed at showcasing movement and interaction.</p>
                    <p>The project began with initial brainstorming sessions to determine the form, scale, and function of the parrot. Sketching was used as the primary conceptual tool, providing a tactile and intuitive way to iterate design ideas before committing to digital work. These sketches played an essential role in shaping the parrot’s physical features, including wing curvature, beak design, and posture. This stage was not only useful for aesthetics but also important in planning mechanical constraints for future movement or articulation.</p>
                    <p>Following the sketching phase, the concept was transferred into a digital environment using 3D modelling software in this case, Blender or Fusion 360. The group sourced a reference 3D model of a parrot (as shown in the image below) and used it as a visual foundation to inform our own digital sculpting approach. While we did not use the model directly, we analysed its structure and attempted to develop a unique version that reflected our own design vision. The modelling process involved reshaping the body, adjusting proportions, and modifying features such as the beak, feathers, and posture to make it distinct from the original. Particular attention was given to symmetry, wing detailing, and realistic topology flow to ensure the model would be both aesthetically compelling and structurally viable for printing.</p>
                    <p>One of the key learning objectives of this module is to understand how physical and digital prototyping techniques interact. As such, every decision in the virtual stage was made with real-world fabrication in mind. The idea of the parrot model was to be split into multiple parts for 3D printing, considering tolerances, joint connections, and ease of assembly. Materials like PLA were considered due to their wide availability and suitability for educational or prototype-grade builds.</p>
                    <p>Throughout the project, particular emphasis was placed on the iterative nature of design. Each stage informed the next, and feedback from one domain often led to adjustments in another. For example, while sculpting the parrot digitally, it became clear that some features were too delicate to print with standard nozzles and would need to be thickened or simplified. Similarly, the process of planning the articulation (e.g., movable wings or rotating neck) influenced the geometry and segmentation of the model.</p>
                    <p>Another reason the parrot was chosen as the prototype is because of its potential future adaptability. While this version of the prototype focuses primarily on the physical structure, future iterations could integrate simple electromechanical systems such as servos or microcontrollers to allow for motion. The parrot’s natural range of movement offers many possibilities for exploring robotics, including wing flapping, head tilting, and vocal mimicry. These possibilities helped motivate the shape and scale choices during the sketching and modelling phases, aiming to create a frame that could one day house electronics. </p>
                    <p>Furthermore, the project helps bridge the gap between creative expression and technical execution. An important intersection in modern engineering education. The ability to combine artistic sensibility with practical fabrication techniques is increasingly valuable in industries that prioritise user experience and aesthetics alongside functionality. Whether designing animatronics, smart toys, or bio-inspired machines, professionals must understand both form and function, and this project provides an entry point into that mindset.</p>
                    <p>Ultimately, this portfolio aims to document the complete journey of creating a robotic parrot prototype, from idea to execution. It reflects both the creative imagination required in conceptual design and the structured, technical thinking involved in bringing a design to life. By presenting this work in a cohesive narrative supported by visuals, critical reflections, and justifications, the portfolio serves both as an academic submission and a potential showcase of practical design capability.</p>

                    <h2 class="major">Virtual Prototype</h2>
                    <p>Using Blender, the parrot sketch was translated into a virtual 3D model. The design focused on recreating key features such as the beak, wings, and body shape. The modelling process involved sculpting, mirroring, and basic mesh editing tools to create a smooth, organic structure that resembles a parrot.</p>
                    <p>This model served as a starting point for experimentation. One of the group’s core objectives was to transform the base design into something original and more in line with the creative and functional vision outlined in our early sketches. The sourced model included distinctive features such as exaggerated wingspan, a perched stance, and a pirate hat. All of which presented opportunities to either refine or redesign aspects to make the final outcome more fitting for a robotics-oriented prototype.</p>
                    <p>We set out with the intention of modifying the original geometry using Blender’s sculpting and mesh editing tools. The idea was not to rely on the existing model for the final result but to use it as a base to dissect and evolve into something that would feel uniquely ours. The plan included reshaping areas such as the wings to allow for potential articulation points and simplifying the textures on the body to make it more suitable for a printable, modular design. The pirate hat feature present in the original model was also identified as something we might remove or replace with a more technical or minimalistic headpiece, aligning the design more closely with a robotic aesthetic.</p>
                    <p>Special attention was intended to be given to structural and symmetrical adjustments. The plan was to use Blender’s mirror modifier to maintain perfect symmetry while experimenting with variations in the wing configuration, beak shape, and leg structure. This approach would allow changes made on one side of the model to be automatically mirrored on the other, helping reduce modelling time and ensure visual consistency. Additionally, we aimed to decimate and clean the mesh to simplify the geometry while preserving essential form details. A necessary step to prepare the model for slicing and 3D printing later on.</p>
                    <p>One of the main challenges faced in this stage of the project was maintaining the balance between stylisation and realism. While the original model is quite dramatic and artistic in pose, our goal was to refine it toward a design that could be broken into parts for physical fabrication. That meant reducing unnecessary complexity and considering the practicalities of print orientation, support structures, and assembly. The idea was to redesign the feet, claws, and base of the parrot to either flatten or modularise them, making the model easier to print and better suited for future articulation.</p>
                    <p>At this point in development, the team is still actively working on evolving the model further. We are exploring ways to break the model into multiple parts such as detachable wings, a separate head, and a modular base that could allow for movement or electronics to be added later.</p>
                    <p>While the current model started from an external reference, the design direction is intended to become increasingly our own. The planned modifications are guided by both aesthetic goals and engineering constraints. The group remains committed to continuing development and pushing the design further in terms of creativity and technical execution, with the ultimate aim of producing a 3D model that is not only visually appealing but also functionally viable for future physical prototyping and robotic experimentation.</p>

        <!-- Physical Prototype -->
        <section id="physical" class="wrapper spotlight style3">

                <div class="content">
                    <h2 class="major">Physical Prototype</h2>
                    <p>The physical prototyping phase of the project is currently in the planning stage, with a clear roadmap laid out for fabrication. The group’s objective is to bring the digital parrot model into the physical world using additive manufacturing techniques specifically, PLA filament. PLA (Polylactic Acid) was selected due to its affordability, ease of use, and reliability when printing intricate shapes. It is one of the most common materials used in academic and prototyping environments because it produces consistent results and is biodegradable, making it a more environmentally friendly option.</p>
                    <p>A key element of the fabrication plan involves strategically segmenting the parrot model into modular parts. Rather than printing the entire structure as a single solid object which would be prone to print failures and inefficiencies the parrot will be split into logical, functional sections. The main components identified for separation include the head, body, wings, claws, and tail. This approach not only improves print success rates but also simplifies post processing and allows for iterative design adjustments if certain parts need to be reprinted individually.</p>
                    <p>The modular approach also supports future ambitions of adding basic articulation. For example, the wings could be printed as separate pieces with hinge like mechanisms incorporated into the design. These mechanisms may allow for simple pivoting or flapping motion, controlled either manually or potentially with micro servo motors in later development phases. Similarly, separating the neck from the body allows for experimentation with limited rotational movement, which would simulate a parrot turning its head. A gesture that adds character and mimics lifelike behaviour.</p>
                    <p>To achieve reliable prints, careful planning around print orientation, support structure placement, and material usage is required. Each segment will be positioned in a way that minimises overhangs and maximises stability during the print process. Wings, for instance, with their thin, outstretched geometry, present a unique challenge. Printing them flat along the bed may reduce warping but may sacrifice detail. Alternatively, printing vertically might capture finer feather textures but require additional support material and increase the risk of layer separation. These trade-offs are being assessed through test prints and slicing simulations.</p>
                    <p>Supports and rafts will be used where necessary, particularly for complex elements like undercuts in the claws or the recessed features around the beak. The aim is to strike a balance between structural integrity during the print and ease of post processing. Wherever possible, the model will be edited to reduce reliance on supports by incorporating gentle overhangs and flat contact points with the print bed.</p>
                    <p>Assembly is another crucial aspect of the plan. Once all components are printed, they will be aligned and joined using a combination of methods: press fitting, adhesives (hot glue), and mechanical features such as dowels or slots designed directly into the CAD model. Depending on how tightly the parts fit, some sanding or filing may be required to ensure clean joins and remove minor print imperfections.</p>
                    <p>Surface finishing is also part of the post processing plan. Although PLA can yield reasonably smooth prints, visible layer lines are inevitable, especially on curved surfaces like the parrot’s body. To address this, the group plans to sand the most exposed parts, particularly the head and wings, and may apply a thin layer of primer or paint to enhance visual appearance. This finishing step not only improves aesthetics but helps convey the product feel of a professional prototype a consideration that is often crucial in early-stage design evaluations.</p>
                    <p>Beyond aesthetics and physical structure, one of the exciting possibilities being explored is adding functional enhancements to the prototype. While this version of the parrot will remain non electronic, the modular design will leave space and flexibility for future iterations. For example, cavities or mounting points may be added to the inside of the base to house small servos, wires, or microcontrollers. This future proofing mindset reflects the team’s desire to treat the prototype not as a static sculpture, but as the potential foundation for a more advanced robotic artefact.</p>
                    <p>In terms of size, the parrot prototype is expected to be printed at a scale that balances visual impact with practical constraints of the printer’s build volume. The group is aiming for a height between 15 to 25 centimetres for the full assembled model, large enough to show detail and allow for articulation, but small enough to fit comfortably on a standard printer bed. If necessary, larger parts such as the body may be split further to fit within size limits.</p>
                    <p>As part of the planning, risks and limitations are being considered as well. Common challenges with PLA printing include warping, stringing between fine details (especially feathers), and layer adhesion failure during long prints.</p>
                    <p>Overall, the plan for the physical prototype reflects a thoughtful and flexible approach to fabrication. The goal is to produce a physical object that matches the intent of the digital design while preparing the ground for future robotic functionality. By breaking the model into manageable parts, choosing reliable materials, and planning for post processing and articulation, the team aims to create a model of a parrot.</p>

        <!-- Critical Appraisal -->

                <h2 class="major">Critical Appraisal</h2>
                <p>Throughout this project, a variety of tools, technologies, and prototyping methods were explored and evaluated in the context of developing the robotic parrot prototype. Each decision from 3D modelling to material selection was made by weighing practicality, accuracy, accessibility, and alignment with the goals of the project. In doing so, the group aimed to create a workflow that not only allowed for effective design execution but also reflected realistic industry and academic constraints.</p>
                <p>For the digital modelling stage, Blender was selected due to its powerful sculpting capabilities and strong support for creating organic, curved forms. Given that a parrot’s anatomy includes smooth contours, intricate feather layering, and expressive shapes, Blender’s sculpting and mesh editing tools proved highly appropriate. The team particularly appreciated Blender’s flexibility in handling symmetrical features and complex geometry, making it an ideal tool for manipulating and refining elements such as wings, claws, and facial features. Its open-source nature and active online community also made learning and troubleshooting more accessible, which was a practical advantage in a student setting.</p>
                <p>While Blender was the tool used, the group briefly considered alternatives such as Fusion 360. Fusion 360, while excellent for precise engineering designs and parametric modelling, was found to be less suited to organic, naturalistic structures like feathers and body curves.</p>
                <p>For the physical prototyping stage, the team chose PLA filament as the primary production method. PLA was chosen for several reasons: it is widely available, cost effective, and relatively forgiving when printing complex shapes. These attributes make it well suited for educational settings and iterative prototyping. However, PLA is not without its limitations. The group anticipates issues with resolution and structural strength, especially when printing fine details such as feathers. Furthermore, PLAs may limit the range of mechanical features that can be integrated without breakage.</p>
                <p>To address these concerns, the team explored alternative fabrication methods, including resin printing and laser cutting. Resin printing was considered as it offers significantly higher resolution and surface detail, making it ideal for smaller features. However, the increased cost, messier post processing, and required safety precautions made it less practical for this initial prototype. Laser cutting was also ruled out, as the parrot’s form is highly three dimensional and organic characteristics that do not lend themselves well to 2D cutting techniques.</p>
                <p>The idea of using composite materials, such as fibre reinforced resin or flexible TPU filament, was also discussed. While these could increase durability or realism, they were ultimately deemed too complex for the project’s current scope. Factors such as printer compatibility, cost per gram, and extended post processing time presented significant trade-offs.</p>
                <p>In conclusion, the selected tools and techniques reflect a balanced, well-reasoned approach to prototyping. Blender allowed for expressive and complex 3D modelling, while printing with PLA offered a low cost and reliable way to begin physical fabrication. Although alternatives could offer enhanced precision or realism, the methods chosen appropriately to reflect the needs and constraints of the academic context. Future iterations of the prototype could revisit these alternatives if more advanced functionality or realism is required.</p>

            <h2 class="major">Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The development of the robotic parrot prototype provided a comprehensive experience in conceptual design, digital modelling, and planning for physical fabrication. Although the final prototype has not yet been physically printed, the process of transitioning from sketches to a detailed 3D model offered invaluable insight into the practicalities and challenges of multidisciplinary prototyping. This project has highlighted the importance of early design exploration, as the initial sketching phase helped shape both the creative and technical direction of the final concept.</p>

            <p>By working with 3D modelling software such as Blender, the group was able to bring the vision of the parrot to life in a virtual space. Blender’s tools enabled the modelling of complex organic forms, symmetrical structures, and detailed features, all of which contributed to a digital prototype that balances realism with feasibility. While a reference model was used at the start, deliberate effort was made to modify, personalise, and evolve the design to reflect the group’s own creative intentions.</p>

            <p>The fabrication planning process reinforced the importance of considering material properties, printer constraints, and assembly logic even during the design phase. Although 3D printing has not yet been carried out, careful thought has been given to part separation, joint design, and post processing. This foresight ensures that once printing begins, the process will be efficient and guided by a clear strategy.</p>

            <p>Another key outcome of this project was the opportunity to work collaboratively in a group setting. Tasks were divided based on individual strengths, and regular discussions helped refine design decisions and challenge assumptions. This collaborative environment mirrored real-world product development processes and encouraged valuable teamwork and communication skills.</p>

            <p>Furthermore, this project provided a realistic introduction to how industry and academia intersect in the field of prototyping. The decisions made were not just creative but had to consider material limitations, software capabilities, and time constraints. All of which reflect common challenges in engineering and design disciplines. These limitations fostered innovation within boundaries, pushing the group to think critically at every step.</p>

            <p>In conclusion, this project represents a strong foundation for future development. It showcases an understanding of both the artistic and technical aspects of prototyping and reflects the potential for continued growth. Should time and resources allow, future iterations of the parrot could involve robotic movement, interactive features, or improved physical realism. Regardless, the project has already succeeded in demonstrating a complete design process from concept to planned execution, and it reflects both individual contribution and collaborative effort in solving a creative engineering challenge.</p>
