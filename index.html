    <h2>Introduction</h2>
   <p>This project focuses on designing a robotic parrot prototype as part of the Robotic Modelling and Drone Skin Design module. The goal was to explore both virtual and physical prototyping processes, beginning with hand-drawn sketches to visualize the concept and inform later stages of CAD and physical design.</p>

    <h2>Virtual Prototype</h2>
    <p>Using Blender, the parrot sketch was translated into a virtual 3D model. The design focused on recreating key features such as the beak, wings, and body shape. The modelling process involved sculpting, mirroring, and basic mesh editing tools to create a smooth, organic structure that resembles a parrot.</p>

<section id="physical">
    <h2>Physical Prototype</h2>
    <p>The group intends to 3D print the parrot model. The current plan is to separate the model into multiple parts such as the body, wings, beak, and claws to simplify the printing and assembly process. Once printed, the components will be assembled. After assembly, the final prototype will be evaluated for balance, proportion, and realism to reflect the initial design intent. We also plan to incorporate basic articulation in the wings or neck to simulate simple robotic movement.</p>

<section id="appraisal">
    <h2>Critical Appraisal</h2>
    <p>Throughout this project, various tools and techniques have been explored to develop the parrot prototype. Blender was selected for 3D modelling due to its powerful sculpting tools and flexibility in creating organic shapes, which suited the parrotâ€™s curved and feathered form. The group found it particularly effective for designing naturalistic body features.</p>

    <p>Alternative methods such as resin printing, laser cutting, or composite materials were considered. Resin printing could offer finer detail but would increase cost and complexity. Laser cutting was deemed unsuitable due to the organic nature of the parrot design. Overall, the selected methods balance realism, practicality, and affordability, making them appropriate for this academic project.</p>
